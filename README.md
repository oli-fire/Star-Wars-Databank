How It Works.

Basic HTML File



Paste this code into any HTML File.
<script src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oli-fire/Star-Wars-Databank/characters.js"></script>


Some Errors You Might Encounter.

1. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML') at characters.js:26:47
